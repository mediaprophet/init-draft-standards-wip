Below is an outline for a ReSpec unofficial draft document proposing an ontological framework to disambiguate and describe the characteristics of software agents, platforms, systems, or software, with a focus on clarifying terms like Human-Centered AI, Human-Centric AI, and related concepts. The document is structured to align with typical ReSpec conventions for clarity and standardization.
Ontology for Describing Software Agent Characteristics: A Framework for Disambiguating Human-Centered and Human-Centric AI

Abstract
This document proposes an ontological framework to standardize the description of software agents, platforms, systems, or software, particularly in the context of Human-Centered AI (HCAI), Human-Centric AI (HCA), and related paradigms. The framework aims to disambiguate overlapping terms, enhance comprehension of agent characteristics, and promote responsible, sustainable, and human-aligned technology development. By defining clear properties, relationships, and classifications, this ontology seeks to improve communication among researchers, developers, policymakers, and stakeholders.

Status of This Document
This is an unofficial draft document and has not been formally endorsed by any standards body. It is intended for discussion and feedback from the AI research, development, and policy communities. Comments and contributions are welcome via [insert feedback mechanism, e.g., GitHub repository or email].

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The proliferation of terms such as Human-Centered AI, Human-Centric AI, and People-Centered AI has led to ambiguity in describing the characteristics, goals, and ethical implications of software agents and systems. This document proposes an ontological framework to systematically describe these entities, enabling precise communication and alignment with human values.
1.2 Scope
The ontology applies to software agents, platforms, systems, or software with AI components, focusing on their human-interaction properties, ethical considerations, and societal impact. It addresses both technical and non-technical characteristics.
1.3 Audience
This document targets:
AI researchers and developers
Policymakers and ethicists
Industry stakeholders
Academic communities studying AI and human-computer interaction
2. Motivation and Problem Statement
2.1 Ambiguity in Existing Terms
Terms like Human-Centered AI and Human-Centric AI are often used interchangeably despite distinct connotations.
Lack of standardized definitions hinders collaboration and evaluation.
Examples: HCAI emphasizes transparency and oversight, while HCA prioritizes symbiotic human-AI integration.
2.2 Need for an Ontological Framework
Ontologies provide structured representations of knowledge, enabling clear classification and relationships.
A dedicated ontology for AI agents can address ambiguity, support interoperability, and guide ethical development.
2.3 Goals
Disambiguate terms like HCAI, HCA, and related paradigms.
Provide a reusable framework for describing agent characteristics.
Promote human responsibility, sustainability, and alignment with societal values.
3. Terminology and Scope
3.1 Definitions
Software Agent: An autonomous or semi-autonomous computational entity capable of performing tasks or decision-making.
Human-Centered AI (HCAI): AI systems designed with a focus on transparency, accountability, fairness, and human oversight.
Human-Centric AI (HCA): AI systems prioritizing human needs, emotions, and symbiotic integration into human life.
Ontology: A formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts, properties, and relationships within a domain.
3.2 Related Concepts
People-Centered AI, Responsible AI, Sustainable AI
Acronyms: HRCAI (Human-Responsible Centric AI), HCSTEW (Human-Centric Sustainable Technological Ecosystems for Wellbeing)
3.3 Scope Limitations
Focuses on AI-driven systems; non-AI software is out of scope unless integrated with AI components.
Does not prescribe specific implementation technologies.
4. Proposed Ontological Framework
4.1 Core Components
Classes: Categories of entities (e.g., Agent, System, Platform).
Properties: Attributes describing entities (e.g., Transparency, Adaptability, Responsibility).
Relationships: Interactions between entities (e.g., Augments, Oversees, AdaptsTo).
4.2 Taxonomy of Agent Characteristics
4.2.1 Human-Interaction Properties
Transparency: Degree to which system decisions are explainable.
Accountability: Mechanisms for assigning responsibility for outcomes.
Adaptability: Ability to adjust to user needs or contexts.
Symbiosis: Extent of integration with human cognition or behavior.
4.2.2 Ethical Properties
Fairness: Equitable treatment of users or stakeholders.
Sustainability: Environmental and societal impact of the system.
Responsibility: Human oversight and accountability for consequences.
4.2.3 Technical Properties
Autonomy: Level of independent decision-making.
Scalability: Ability to handle increased complexity or users.
Interoperability: Compatibility with other systems or standards.
4.3 Relationships
Agent-Human: Augments, Supports, LearnsFrom, AdaptsTo.
Agent-System: IntegratesWith, DependsOn, Controls.
Human-Society: Impacts, Benefits, Governs.
4.4 Proposed Acronyms and Terms
HCAI: Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (focus on transparency, oversight).
HCA: Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence (focus on symbiosis, personalization).
HRCAI: Human-Responsible Centric AI (emphasis on human accountability).
HCSTEW: Human-Centric Sustainable Technological Ecosystems for Wellbeing.
4.5 Formal Representation
Ontology to be expressed in OWL (Web Ontology Language) or similar.
Example structure:
plaintext
Class: Agent
  SubClassOf: System
  Properties: hasTransparency, hasAdaptability
  Relationships: augments(Human), adaptsTo(Context)
5. Application of the Framework
5.1 Use Cases
Healthcare: Describing AI diagnostic tools with properties like transparency and fairness.
Education: Classifying adaptive learning systems as HCA with high symbiosis.
Policy: Guiding regulations based on agent responsibility and sustainability.
5.2 Example Annotations
System: AI-driven healthcare platform
Class: Agent
Properties: High Transparency, Medium Adaptability
Relationships: Augments(Clinician), Impacts(Patient)
5.3 Benefits
Improved clarity in academic and industry discussions.
Enhanced evaluation of AI systems for ethical alignment.
Support for interoperable standards in AI development.
6. Implementation Considerations
6.1 Technical Implementation
Use of semantic web technologies (RDF, OWL) for ontology encoding.
Integration with existing AI metadata standards (e.g., ML Schema).
6.2 Adoption Strategies
Collaboration with standards bodies (e.g., W3C, IEEE).
Open-source ontology repository for community contributions.
Training materials for developers and policymakers.
6.3 Challenges
Resistance to standardization due to diverse stakeholder priorities.
Complexity of capturing nuanced human-AI interactions.
Evolving nature of AI requiring ontology updates.
7. Future Work
Develop a reference implementation of the ontology.
Conduct case studies to validate the framework.
Extend the ontology to non-AI systems or emerging technologies.
Engage with global AI ethics initiatives for alignment.

Notes on ReSpec Conventions
This outline assumes the use of ReSpec for generating HTML-based specifications.
Sections like "Status of This Document" and "Abstract" follow W3C-style conventions.
The document can be extended with ReSpec-specific markup (e.g., data-dfn-for) for definitions and cross-references.
A formal ReSpec template can be applied for publication, including boilerplate for W3C or independent drafts.
Next Steps
If desired, I can generate a full ReSpec HTML draft with placeholder content.
Feedback on specific sections or ontology components can guide further refinement.
Additional use cases or acronym suggestions can be incorporated.
Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!
