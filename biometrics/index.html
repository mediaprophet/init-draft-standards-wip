        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This specification defines a standardized framework for the Human Centric management of biometric information (data), ensuring personal ownership, secure storage, and permissive discoverability and usage through privacy-preserving technologies. Leveraging semantic web standards (excluding OWL and Schema.org), it enables interoperable, secure, and user-controlled biometric systems that uphold the inalienable nature of biometric data as an extension of personal identity. The framework supports use cases in justice, healthcare, and identity verification while prioritizing privacy, security, and individual autonomy.

        <p>
            This is an unofficial draft specification intended for community review and feedback. It has not been endorsed by any standards body and is subject to change based on further development and input.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial recognition patterns, and iris scans, are unique identifiers inherently tied to an individualâ€™s identity. As digital transformation accelerates, the management of biometric data raises significant concerns about privacy, security, and personal autonomy. Centralized systems often undermine individual control, increasing risks of misuse, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            This specification proposes a decentralized framework for biometric data management, where individuals retain ownership and control over their data, recognized as an inalienable extension of self. By utilizing semantic web standards (specifically RDF Schema and SPARQL extensions, excluding OWL and Schema.org), decentralized storage technologies, and cryptographic methods like zero-knowledge proofs, this framework ensures secure storage, consent-based discoverability, and privacy-preserving usage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The framework aligns with human rights principles (e.g., <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">UDHR</a>, Article 12) and philosophical considerations of personal identity and autonomy, ensuring that digital transformation upholds the sanctity of natural persons.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The decentralized biometrics system is built on a distributed architecture where biometric data resides in individual <a>Personal Data Stores (PDS)</a>. No single entity controls the data, and access is granted only through consent-based mechanisms.
        </p>

            <h3>Key Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Data Store (PDS):</strong> A decentralized, encrypted storage unit controlled by the individual or their guardian, hosting biometric records.</li>
                <li><strong>Identity Provider:</strong> A service that authenticates identities using cryptographic proofs without accessing raw biometric data.</li>
                <li><strong>Query Federation:</strong> A system for querying biometric data across PDSs using <a>SPARQL-Fed</a>, ensuring decentralized access.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent Manager:</strong> A mechanism to manage and enforce user consent for data access, implemented via cryptographic signatures or smart contracts.</li>

    <section id="storage">
        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Biometric data is stored in a decentralized manner using technologies like <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> or blockchain-based solutions. Each <a>PDS</a> is encrypted, with access restricted to the owner or authorized guardians.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IPFS Integration:</strong> Biometric data is encrypted and stored on IPFS, with content hashes recorded on a blockchain for integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data is encrypted using AES-256 or equivalent standards for both at-rest and in-transit protection.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Keys:</strong> Cryptographic keys are managed by the individual or their guardian, ensuring exclusive control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

    <section id="discoverability">
        <h2>Discoverability and Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Discoverability and usage are enabled through semantic web querying standards:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SPARQL-MM:</strong> Supports queries over multimedia biometric data (e.g., facial recognition patterns). If not standardized, implementations <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em> define a compatible extension.</li>
            <li><strong>SPARQL-Fed:</strong> Enables federated queries across PDSs, allowing authorized parties to search without centralizing data [[SPARQL11-FEDERATED-QUERY]].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Example SPARQL query to locate biometric records with specific attributes:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="sparql">

SELECT ?record
WHERE {
    ?record a db:BiometricRecord ;

    FILTER (?consent = "authorized")

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authorization:</strong> Guardians are designated through secure, auditable processes (e.g., legal documentation or multi-party consent).</li>
