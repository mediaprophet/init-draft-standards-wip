        <p>
          This document proposes an ontological framework for describing entities (legal or natural, including those with legal personhood or dependents) and their associations with software agents, platforms, or systems. The framework aims to provide a standardized means to characterize entities and their relationships with agents, ensuring clarity in roles, responsibilities, and interactions. By defining properties, relationships, and classifications, this ontology enhances communication among researchers, developers, policymakers, and stakeholders in contexts involving human-agent interactions.

      This is an unofficial draft document and has not been formally endorsed by any standards body. It is intended for discussion and feedback from the AI, legal, and ethics communities.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section id="purpose">
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The description of entities—whether legal entities (e.g., corporations, organizations) or natural entities (e.g., adults with legal personhood or dependents like children)—requires a structured framework to clarify their characteristics and associations with software agents. This ontology provides a standardized approach to describe entities and their interactions with agents, facilitating precise communication and alignment with legal, ethical, and societal frameworks.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope">
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        The ontology applies to legal and natural entities and their associations with software agents, platforms, or systems, particularly in AI-driven contexts. It addresses entity characteristics, legal status, and agent-entity relationships, including ethical and responsibility considerations.

    <h2>Motivation and Problem Statement</h2>
    <section id="ambiguity">
      <h3>Ambiguity in Entity-Agent Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        The lack of a standardized framework for describing entities (legal or natural) and their interactions with software agents leads to ambiguity in roles, responsibilities, and legal implications. For example, associating an agent with a child (dependent) versus an adult (legal person) requires distinct considerations for accountability and oversight.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="need-for-ontology">
      <h3>Need for an Ontological Framework</h3>
      <p>
        An ontology provides a structured representation of entities and their relationships with agents, enabling clear classification and interoperability. This framework supports legal, ethical, and technical alignment in human-agent interactions.
