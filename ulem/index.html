    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This specification defines the Universal Language Encoding Methodology (ULEM), a framework for encoding and representing diverse linguistic systems, including spoken, signed, symbolic, and phonetic languages, particularly those not supported by Unicode. ULEM aims to provide a standardized, interoperable, and culturally sensitive approach to language encoding, supporting accessibility, preservation, and digital integration.

    <h2>Status of This Document</h2>
    <p>
      This is a draft specification for the Universal Language Encoding Methodology (ULEM). It is a work in progress and subject to revision based on community feedback, technical advancements, and implementation experience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Existing encoding standards, such as Unicode, provide robust support for many written languages but fall short for certain mother tongue languages, languages of prayer, symbolic systems like heraldry, phonetic representations, and sign languages. The Universal Language Encoding Methodology (ULEM) seeks to address these gaps by defining a flexible, extensible framework for encoding diverse linguistic systems while ensuring interoperability with existing standards.
    </p>
    <section id="goals">
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Develop a universal methodology for encoding unsupported languages and symbolic systems.</li>
        <li>Ensure cultural sensitivity through community-driven design and validation.</li>
        <li>Support multimodal representations (text, phonetic, visual, gestural).</li>
        <li>Foster interoperability with Unicode and other existing standards.</li>
        <li>Enable accessibility for diverse users, including speakers of minority languages and deaf communities.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="scope">
      <h3>Scope</h3>
      <p>
        ULEM covers spoken languages (including phonetics), sign languages, and symbolic systems (e.g., heraldry). It includes encoding mechanisms, representation standards, and guidelines for implementation in digital systems.

  <!-- Methodology -->
  <section id="methodology">
    <h2>ULEM Methodology</h2>
    <section id="principles">
      <h3>Core Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: Support all linguistic systems, including those without written forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: Allow for future additions of new languages or symbols.</li>
        <li><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Align with Unicode where possible and integrate with existing technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Community-Driven</strong>: Involve native speakers and cultural experts in design.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="encoding-framework">
      <h3>Encoding Framework</h3>
      <p>
        ULEM defines a modular encoding framework that supports multiple representation types:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Text-Based Encoding</strong>: Custom code points for scripts or symbols, with mappings to Unicode where feasible.</li>
        <li><strong>Phonetic Encoding</strong>: Extensions to IPA for unsupported sounds, integrated with text-to-speech systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Visual Encoding</strong>: Support for sign languages and symbolic systems (e.g., heraldry) via video, animation, or sign writing.</li>
        <li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Contextual data (e.g., cultural notes, pronunciation rules) to enhance interpretation.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="representation-standards">
      <h3>Representation Standards</h3>
      <p>
        ULEM specifies how encoded elements are displayed and processed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fonts</strong>: Custom fonts for rendering non-Unicode scripts or symbols.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Methods</strong>: Keyboard layouts or gesture-based input for sign languages.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility Tools</strong>: Integration with speech synthesis, sign recognition, and translation systems.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify unique linguistic features (e.g., phonemes, gestures, symbols).</li>
        <li>Validate proposed encodings and representations.</li>
        <li>Ensure cultural appropriateness and acceptance.</li>
