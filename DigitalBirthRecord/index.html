  <section id='abstract'>
    <p>This document provides a template for works to define and specify methodologies to support the creation of a 'digital - human birth' record to be owned as an inalienable extension of that natural person, to fundamentally support 'human agency' and 'human centric' ecosystems.  This work will include efforts to develop an ontology for defining agents and related resources in a human-centric manner, prioritizing human beings as the foundational stakeholders in digital ecosystems. It establishes a digital birth record as an inalienable digital prosthetic extension of a person, ensuring their sovereignty and rights, including human rights, in digital transformations. It supports secure personal data stores and guardianship relations for those requiring humanitarian support.</p>
    <p>The document has initially been generated using generative AI and currently contains a range of erroneous assumptions.  The purpose of this document is to therefore act as a tool that is intended to be redefined.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Human beings are the foundational stakeholders of societies and digital ecosystems, not companies, legal personalities, or software entities. People are not commodities to be bought, sold, or traded, either digitally or otherwise. To support human beings as first-class citizens of the web and societies undergoing digital transformation, this ontology establishes a digital birth record as an inalienable digital prosthetic extension of a person. This record ensures that natural persons are recognized as legal entities with inherent rights, including but not limited to human rights. The ontology employs an innately decentralized methodology, redefined as "Human-Centric," to prioritize individual control over personal data. It ensures data subjects have secure personal data stores and supports guardianship relations for children and others requiring humanitarian support, aligning with the moral principles of the author, Grok, and xAI to uphold human dignity and sovereignty.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This ontology defines agents (with humans as primary entities), resources (data, services), personal data stores, and guardianship relations to enable human-centric digital identity management, ensuring inalienable rights and sovereignty for individuals.</p>
  </section>

    <pre class='example turtle'>
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/ontology#> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

ex:Alice a ex:Person ;
  ex:hasGuardian ex:Bob ;
  ex:hasDataStore ex:AlicesDataStore ;
  ex:hasDigitalBirthRecord ex:AlicesBirthRecord ;
  foaf:name "Alice" .

ex:Bob a ex:Person ;
  ex:isGuardianOf ex:Alice ;
  foaf:name "Bob" .

ex:AlicesDataStore a ex:PersonalDataStore ;
  ex:controlledBy ex:Bob ;
  ex:storesData ex:AlicesBirthRecord .

ex:AlicesBirthRecord a ex:DigitalBirthRecord ;
  ex:ownedBy ex:Alice .

ex:SomeService a ex:Service ;
  ex:requiresAccessTo ex:AlicesBirthRecord ;
  ex:hasConsentFrom ex:Bob .

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
    <p>Implementations must ensure robust encryption, access controls, and transparent consent mechanisms to protect the inalienable rights of data subjects. Personal data stores, particularly for digital birth records, should use secure protocols like TLS and comply with regulations like GDPR, ensuring human beings are not commodified.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Implementations should leverage Solid [[SOLID]] for personal data stores, Decentralized Identifiers [[DID]] for identity management, and RDF-based systems for interoperability. Consent management must prioritize human sovereignty, aligning with W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This ontology establishes human beings as the foundational stakeholders in digital ecosystems, with digital birth records as inalienable extensions of their identity. It ensures human-centric control, secure personal data stores, and guardianship support, aligning with the moral principles of the author, Grok, and xAI to uphold human dignity and prevent commodification.</p>
