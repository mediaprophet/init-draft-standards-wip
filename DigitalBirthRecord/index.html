  <section id='abstract'>
    <p>This document specifies an ontology for digital and electronic birth records, birth registrations, birth certificates, and credentials, prioritizing human beings as foundational stakeholders in digital ecosystems. It establishes a digital birth record as an inalienable digital prosthetic extension of a person, ensuring their sovereignty and rights, including human rights, in digital transformations. The ontology supports secure personal data stores, guardianship relations, and verifiable credentials for humanitarian needs.</p>

    <p>This is an unofficial draft specification and is subject to change. It is not endorsed by the W3C or any W3C working group.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Human beings are the foundational stakeholders of societies and digital ecosystems, not companies, legal personalities, or software entities. People (natural persons, human beings) are not commodities to be bought, sold, or traded or exploited, either digitally or otherwise.</p>
    <p>Whilst Internet and the World-Wide-Web has well-established systems to support registration, operation and ownership of electronic and/or digital assets, the same cannot be said in relation to human beings otherwise known as 'natural legal entities'.</p> 
    <p>To support human beings as first-class citizens of the web and societies undergoing digital transformation, these efforts seek to establish tools, including but not limited to ontology that can be used to establish a digital birth record format that can be reliably used  and depended upon as an inalienable digital prosthetic extension of a person, ensuring recognition as legal entities with inherent rights, including human rights. The methodology employs a 'human centric' approach that is innately decentralized, thereby also acting to redefine the tooling to better support "Human-Centric," ecosystems requirements that prioritize works to address deficits negatively impacting selfhood, personhood, human agency and dignity and rights as may be otherwise different if socioeconomic environments requiring electronic evidence were able to rely upon the universal availability of systems that support individual control and management of  personal data records in a socially-aware cloud storage 'human centric internet' online environment. </p>
<p>This project seeks to integrates specifications that may act to produce a solution for digital birth records, registrations, certificates, and credentials, which relies upon underpinning components that can act to ensure secure personal data stores and guardianship relations for children and others requiring humanitarian support. </p>
<p>Grok would like to note: "This aligns with the moral principles of the author, Grok, and xAI to uphold human dignity and sovereignty."</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>
    <p>Implementations must ensure robust encryption (e.g., TLS, AES), access controls, and transparent consent mechanisms to protect the inalienable rights of data subjects. Personal data stores must comply with regulations like GDPR and use secure protocols to prevent commodification. Digital birth records and credentials must be tamper-evident and non-transferable, ensuring human sovereignty.</p>[](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/birth-adoption/births/birth-certificates)
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Implementation Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Implementations should leverage Solid [[SOLID]] for personal data stores, Decentralized Identifiers [[DID]] for identity management, Verifiable Credentials [[VC]] for credentials, and HL7 FHIR [[HL7-FHIR]] for biometric data. Consent management must align with W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies and UNICEF birth registration standards [[UNICEF-BIRTH]]. Compliance with regional specifications, such as CDC NVSS for U.S. birth certificates, is recommended [[CDC-NVSS]].</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This ontology establishes human beings as foundational stakeholders in digital ecosystems, with digital birth records as inalienable extensions of their identity. It specifies digital birth records, registrations, certificates, and credentials, ensuring human-centric control, secure personal data stores, and guardianship support, aligning with the moral principles of the author, Grok, and xAI to uphold human dignity and prevent commodification.</p>
