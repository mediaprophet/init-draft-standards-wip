# Human Centric AI Thoughts & Projects

The notion of Human Centric AI is thought to require some parts...  

( [Git Repo](https://github.com/mediaprophet/init-draft-standards-wip))

## WIP
This repo has currently been produced - overnight ([See Commit History](https://github.com/mediaprophet/init-draft-standards-wip/commits/main/)) - merely, getting some resources or moreover considerations from historical works quickly processed via local AI and Grok (and a bit of local LLM - meta/llama-3.3-70b), to get something to start with; intending to then either prompt discussion, or enabling means to then improve edits.  There's alot more work still needed and some of the descriptions will not represent the intended texts associated to the historical work or future useful intents & purposes, as LLMs often - don't get it.. This is therefore intended to provide something that is hoped to be more useful, than otherwise, forming a basis for development.  Note also, historical work on 'sense' which provides some additional information about elements that i do not have confidence can be better advanced, yet...  

**[Sense - progress report Spatio-Temporal: Human Centric AI Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fwx3-YYyKgeigaScoMVoTFc3V2p-0jVwOg0IvMr8TZs/edit?tab=t.0)**
Therein also, are some diagrams and such elements about [linked data](https://github.com/linkeddata/) related information management systems, where people store 'their own data' and apps are able to be designed, to run locally, employing underlying semantics and/or 'web of data' ecosystems, that, at-large - end-up, being produced by all participating members of our human family. 


### Use of Generative AI 
Generative AI MAY be used to support the development of these works, however it should be declared that they have in-fact been used.  Whilst part of the purpose of these works is to improve the means through which these declarations can be made, in the interim, the RECOMMENDED approach is to declare the agent that has contributed (model / vendor ("Agent")) and who used it ('entity').  For example:  Timothy Holborn (Identifier), Grok 3/x, meta/llama-3.3-70b.


## Nomenclature
The meaning of 'Human Centric AI' is in itself, contentious.  People seek to define it in different ways, and in-turn also, the acronyms used that may suggest Human Centric AI may also be employed to mean Human Centered AI, which is considered to be a different concept or emboidment of concepts, whilst the ambiguity generally leads to outcomes that are inverse to the intents, purposes, functional designs and ramaifications of what some (such as myself) have sought to define as to be distinguished by the term 'Human Centric', and by extension, "Human Centric AI" or indeed also, moreover as a consequence of the works of others - Human Centric Internet.

To address this issue, a consideration of how the useful meaning of vocabulary may be better defined by its characteristics has therefore been considered as a constituency of these works.  These can then be convayed as categories or classes of services.

## Constituencies
There is no single component that leads to support for Human Centric AI.  Rather, there are a range of components that need to be made to work together.  The structure of these works should be considered an early draft, whereby elements from multiple constituencies may be brought together into singular specification documents; for instance, as may be the case for ontology components; whilst others, may be significantly expanded upon and thereafter forged as constituencies of a broader emboidment of works.

## Primary Future WIP Host(s)
The intention of these works is that they are provided to the [W3C Human Centric AI CG](https://www.w3.org/community/humancentricai/) for consideration with the view to supporting the advancement of these works via appropriate [Internet Governance](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_governance) communities, including but not exclusive to W3C and IETF, with the intended purpose of seeking to establish royalty free - interoperable solutions, that act to render meaningful support for [Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-listings), particularly in areas where material supports are otherwise absent or compromised with thereby unnecessary compromises. Note also, that Human Rights instruments often declare duties of state praties, whereas the advent of 'digital transformation' now therefore empowers our ability to have, maintain and support the human-rights of one-another, for those members of our human family who should seek and/or choose to do so.

## Digital Transformation and Human Rights
Digital transformation is reshaping how societies operate, moving from physical documents to digital systems for identity and agency. This shift impacts human rights, as access to digital tools is becoming essential for exercising fundamental rights like privacy and freedom of expression. This response explores how tools like socially-aware cloud storage, personal information processing systems, and domain names support digital personhood, Human-Centric AI, and the Social Web.
Essential Digital Tools for Personhood
Digital personhood, the ability to have a recognized digital identity, relies on tools like:
Socially-Aware Cloud Storage: Secure, user-controlled storage for personal data, enhancing privacy and data sovereignty.

Personal Information Processing Apparatus: Systems like Personal Data Stores (PDS) that let individuals manage their data, aligning with rights like data rectification and consent withdrawal.

Domain Names: Unique digital addresses that establish online presence, crucial for digital identity and agency.

These tools are vital for participating in digital societies, ensuring individuals can exercise their rights.

### Supporting Human-Centric AI and Social Web
Human-Centric AI prioritizes human values, integrating with user-controlled systems to respect agency. The Social Web envisions a decentralized internet where users control data, supported by open protocols and community governance. Both concepts rely on digital tools to empower individuals, addressing challenges like surveillance and data breaches.

### Challenges and Considerations
While these tools offer opportunities, challenges include the digital divide, privacy risks, and technical barriers like data interoperability. Ensuring universal access and ethical AI development is crucial for an inclusive digital future.
Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Digital Transformation, Personhood, and Human Rights

### Introduction and Context
Digital transformation, as of June 20, 2025, has fundamentally altered societal operations, shifting from reliance on physical, non-digital evidence (e.g., printed documents) to digital systems for establishing identity, agency, and access to services. This transformation has profound implications for human rights, as access to digital infrastructure increasingly underpins personhood and human agency. Historically, societies relied on printed documents like birth certificates and passports to establish identity, but increasingly, digital tools are necessary for exercising fundamental rights. This survey note explores the considerations, implications, and objective purposes required to support a Social Web or Social Internet, and in turn, Human-Centric AI and a Human-Centric Internet, focusing on the need for socially-aware cloud storage, personal information processing apparatus, and domain names.


### Digital Personhood and Human Rights: Definitions and Importance
Digital personhood refers to an individual's ability to establish and maintain a recognized digital identity, enabling participation in digital ecosystems while exercising agency and rights. Research, such as from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Digital space and human rights, highlights that digital technologies affect all types of human rights—civil, political, economic, social, and cultural—both enhancing and undermining them. For instance, digital tools can advocate for rights but also enable surveillance, censorship, and algorithmic bias, disproportionately impacting marginalized groups.
The importance of digital personhood lies in its role as a foundation for human rights in the digital age. Without access to digital tools, individuals risk exclusion from societal, economic, and political systems, undermining rights like privacy, data protection, freedom of expression, access to information, and non-discrimination. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human rights-based digital transformation emphasizes placing human rights at the center of digital transformation, understanding the real impact of digital technologies on these rights.

### Essential Digital Tools for Digital Personhood
To support digital personhood, individuals require specific digital tools, each with distinct roles and implications:
Socially-Aware Cloud Storage: This refers to cloud services that prioritize user privacy, autonomy, and data sovereignty. Such storage allows individuals to store and manage their data securely, with control over access and usage. For example, platforms like pCloud Europe's Most Secure Cloud Storage emphasize encryption and GDPR compliance, aligning with privacy rights. Research from Thomson Reuters Understanding cloud data protection and data privacy underscores the importance of data security and control, crucial for protecting personal data and ensuring privacy, a fundamental human right.

Personal Information Processing Apparatus (PIPA): This includes tools and systems like Personal Data Stores (PDS) that enable individuals to process their personal data independently. A detailed review from PMC Personal Data Stores (PDS): A Review shows PDS empower users to collect, store, manage, and share data, promoting self-sovereignty. They align with GDPR, enabling rights like data rectification, the right to be forgotten, and consent withdrawal. PDS reduce risks of data breaches and support data trading for economic value, enhancing privacy and agency. Benefits include user empowerment, security enhancement, and profit from data monetization, though challenges include lack of technical expertise and data interoperability.

Domain Names: Domain names provide a unique, user-controlled digital address, enhancing discoverability and asserting digital identity. The Danish Institute for Human Rights Developing a human rights impact assessment model for internet domain registries notes that domain registries have potential human rights impacts, affecting freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy. For instance, government requests to redirect websites can impact expression, while publishing registrant data affects privacy. Domain names are crucial for establishing a digital presence, supporting Human-Centric AI by enabling control over online interactions.

### Human-Centric AI and the Social Web: Interconnections
Human-Centric AI is designed to prioritize human values, agency, and well-being, integrating with user-owned digital assets like domain names and PDS. It involves developing AI systems that respect user consent, transparency, and ethical data use, as highlighted in OECD discussions Human rights in the digital age. This ensures AI enhances rather than undermines digital personhood, addressing risks like algorithmic bias and automated decision-making systems.
The Social Web or Social Internet envisions a decentralized, user-driven internet where individuals control their data and interactions. This requires open protocols, interoperable platforms, and community-driven governance models, as discussed in Human Rights Watch Human Rights in the Digital Age. Tools like PDS and domain names are essential, empowering users to manage digital identities autonomously. This vision supports Human-Centric AI by providing a foundation where users can engage with AI systems on their own terms, reducing risks of surveillance and data exploitation.

### Objective Purposes and Implementation Strategies
To support digital personhood, Human-Centric AI, and the Social Web, the following objective purposes are necessary, with implementation strategies:
Objective Purpose

### Description

These purposes address challenges like the digital divide, privacy risks, and technical barriers, ensuring an inclusive digital future.

### Implications for Human Rights
The shift to a digital society has significant implications for human rights, as outlined below:
Right to Access: Universal access to digital tools is essential for participating in modern society, akin to rights to education or expression. The digital divide, as noted in UN Social Development Commission discussions Human Rights-Based Technology Policies, risks excluding vulnerable populations, necessitating policies to bridge gaps.

Right to Privacy: User-controlled data systems, like PDS and secure cloud storage, protect individuals from surveillance and exploitation. OHCHR OHCHR and privacy in the digital age highlights risks from data-intensive technologies, emphasizing the need for safeguards.

Right to Agency: Personal domain names and decentralized platforms empower individuals to control digital presence and interactions, enhancing autonomy. This aligns with discussions on digital democracy and personhood, as seen in arXiv Identity and Personhood in Digital Democracy.

Right to Inclusion: Bridging the digital divide ensures marginalized communities are not excluded from economic, social, or political opportunities, supporting non-discrimination principles. This is crucial for addressing inequalities highlighted in UNDP reports The Impact of Digital Technology on Human Rights in Europe and Central Asia.

Challenges and Considerations
Despite the opportunities, challenges persist. The digital divide, as discussed in OECD Shaping a rights-oriented digital transformation, exacerbates social inequalities, particularly in underserved regions. Privacy and security risks, such as data breaches, are noted in ISACA Cloud Data Sovereignty Governance and Risk Implications. Interoperability issues and high costs of domain names or devices may exclude low-income individuals, as seen in VerifiMe Personhood: What Is It and How Do We Protect It?. Ethical AI development and community-driven governance models require coordinated efforts among governments, technologists, and civil society.
Conclusion

Digital transformation has redefined personhood to include digital access, identity, and agency. To support a Social Web and Human-Centric AI, individuals must have access to essential digital tools like socially-aware cloud storage, personal information processing systems, and domain names. These tools are critical for establishing digital personhood and exercising human rights in the digital age. Achieving this requires addressing challenges through universal access, user-controlled systems, and inclusive policies, ensuring an equitable, privacy-respecting digital future as of June 20, 2025.

**Digital Personhood and Human Rights: A Framework for Human Centric AI and Social Internet**

**Executive Summary**

The Digital Transformation is revolutionizing the way societies function, with significant implications for human rights. As digital technologies become increasingly integral to daily life, individuals' needs are evolving to include fundamental digital, internet, and ICT requirements. This document outlines the concept of digital personhood and its relationship to human agency, highlighting the essential supports for human rights in the digital era. We propose a framework that incorporates socially-aware cloud storage, personal information processing apparatus, and key tools, including domain names, to support Human Centric AI and Social Internet.

**Introduction**

The advent of digital technologies has transformed the way individuals interact, access information, and exercise their rights. Historically, societies have relied on non-digital evidence, such as printed documents, to establish personhood and human agency. However, with the increasing digitization of daily life, it is essential to recognize the importance of digital supports for human rights.

**Digital Personhood and Human Agency**

Digital personhood refers to the concept that individuals require a set of digital tools and infrastructure to fully exercise their human rights and participate in the digital economy. This includes:

1. **Socially-aware cloud storage**: A secure, accessible, and private online space for storing personal data, documents, and information.
2. **Personal information processing apparatus**: Tools and services that enable individuals to manage, process, and control their personal data.
3. **Key tools and domain names**: Essential digital identities, such as domain names, that facilitate online presence, communication, and interaction.

These digital supports are essential for human agency, enabling individuals to:

1. Exercise autonomy and self-determination
2. Access information and knowledge
3. Participate in economic and social activities
4. Establish and maintain relationships
5. Protect their privacy and security

**Human Centric AI and Social Internet**

The development of Human Centric AI and Social Internet requires a deep understanding of digital personhood and human agency. By prioritizing individual needs and rights, we can create a more inclusive, equitable, and just digital ecosystem.

1. **Human Centric AI**: AI systems that prioritize human well-being, dignity, and autonomy, and are designed to augment and support human capabilities.
2. **Social Internet**: A decentralized, community-driven internet that promotes social interaction, collaboration, and mutual support.

**Objective Intents & Purposes**

To support the development of Human Centric AI and Social Internet, the following objectives are considered:

1. **Establish digital personhood as a fundamental human right**: Recognize the essential role of digital supports in enabling human agency and dignity.
2. **Develop socially-aware cloud storage and personal information processing apparatus**: Create secure, accessible, and private online spaces for individuals to manage their personal data.
3. **Promote domain name ownership and digital identity**: Facilitate individual access to domain names and digital identities, ensuring equal opportunities for online participation.
4. **Foster a culture of digital literacy and inclusion**: Educate individuals about the importance of digital personhood, human agency, and online safety.
5. **Encourage decentralized and community-driven internet governance**: Support the development of Social Internet and Human Centric AI through inclusive, participatory, and transparent governance models.

**Conclusion**

The Digital Transformation presents both opportunities and challenges for human rights. By recognizing the importance of digital personhood and human agency, we can create a more just and equitable digital ecosystem. This framework provides a foundation for supporting Human Centric AI and Social Internet, prioritizing individual needs and rights in the development of digital technologies.

**Recommendations**

1. **Conducting further research**: Investigating the implications of digital personhood on human rights, and exploring the development of socially-aware cloud storage and personal information processing apparatus via a interdiciplinary approach is required.
2. **Develop policies and guidelines**: Establishing clear policies and guidelines for the promotion of semantic and ontological literacy, social inclusion, and online safety is required and requires humanitarian advocacy via an interdisciplinary approach.  Whilst tooling can be produced to improve accessibility it is often not already available, despite technical capacities that exist more broadly and as has been otherwise operationally deployed, decades ago (albeit for different purposes).
3. **Encourage international cooperation**: Fostering global collaboration to address the challenges and opportunities presented by 'Digital Transformation' requires socioeconomic considerations as to proportionately support, protection and safety measures works and workers focused on tasks considered desirably advanced for our humanity.
4. **Support community-driven initiatives**: Promotion of awareness of how existing information systems are decentralized and how community-driven internet and information (electronic evidence) governance & employment models that prioritize human centricity, social welfare and responsibility can be applied in connection to human rights principles, is a necessity.  (ie: most people don't understand how an 'app' or its underlying CDN infrastructure works vs. the legal / IP control/'ownership' systems).

By working together to address these challenges and opportunities, we can create a digital ecosystem that supports human dignity, autonomy, and well-being, and ensures that the benefits of digital technologies are accessible to all.

## Foundational Works

The production of these components as to engineer solutions that are different to the function of 'information management systems' generally otherwise, would not be possible without the prior-works done by many, yet relatively few members of our human family - earlier, overtime.  there are many areas that contribute towards the means to achieve the type of outcome these efforts now seek to better realise, only some relate to internet and/or web-standards and/or software.

Where works does relate to - royalty free - software...  as may then in-turn act to better support 'freedom of thought', and in-turn the personal ownership akin to prosthetics, extension of an individuals 'mindware', notwithstanding complexities...

The following projects are of particular note;

- [WebID](https://www.w3.org/community/webid/)
- [RWW](https://www.w3.org/community/rww/)

Efforts to forge a 'web of data' or ['semantic web'](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Main_Page) to address 'semantics' has been on-going since [1994](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkjyCPuTKPw) if not before.  There are many elements associated to these works, which can be reviewed by searching the [w3c email mailing lists](https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Public/search?indexes=Public&resultsperpage=100&sortby=date-asc) including 'web-payments' which acted to bring about works on ['verifiable claims'](https://w3c.github.io/vctf/), ['credentials'](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/2014/08/06/call-for-participation-in-credentials-community-group/) and ['decentralised identifiers'](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/), whilst the growth of [ldp](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/) and works relating to [design issues](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/) and our means to address [social web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7qOhjja7jM) issues, thereby also leading to efforts to advanced what is currently known of as [solid](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/).  

### Reality 'check' Tech

IF These works are done properly, then the outcome should be that in MOST cases, people are able to better understand the provonance and history of how things come about. This is important for the protection of human rights in society, socioeconomically, and in relation to the peacefeul resolution of disputes, in courts of law, as is amongst the many implications.  As such, the focus is on the definition of apparatus that provides these qualities, which should therefore act as to clarify the truer nature of ourselves and the world around us; at the macroscopic and microscopic levels, et. al.

## AUTHOR NOTE
Historical works have been undertaken in difficult circumstances.  In what was already difficult cirumstances, The ramifications of 'covid' and my choice not to support the global deployment of 'vaccine passports' has led to serious harm and impairment, including but no exclusive to significant harms via applied policies resulting in an inability to access otherwise necessary healthcare, associated with infection and chronic pain over years, whilst said to be 'on waiting lists' and/or similar.  As such, my ability to do better, has been impaired. Best efforts are being made, in difficult circumstances, whilst having managed to survive and improve to some-degree thereby enabling me to concentrate enough to do these works as illustrated.  Support, Humanitarianly focused expertise and resources are sought to assist with the development of these works towards 'fit for purpose' outcomes; whether or not, i continue to be able to do so to any degree and/or if at all.
